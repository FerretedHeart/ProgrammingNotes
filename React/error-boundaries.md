# Error Boundaries

[Error Boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) are React components that catch runtime errors anywhere in their child component tree. The error boundary can log those errors and display a backup user-interface (a "fallback UI") instead of a blank screen. Error boundaries are commonly used around new features that have not been thoroughly tested as they allow you to recover in the event of an error.
